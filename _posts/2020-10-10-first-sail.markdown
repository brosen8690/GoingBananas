After a lot of work with my dad to fix the jib rigging on the roller furling, and a few windless days out, the stage was finally set for Banana's first real sail! Our friends Kevin and Anisha were in town and they were lucky enough to experience it with us.

It was a very windy day and I learned that while I have a lot of experience as crew on a sailboat, I don't have any experience as a skipper. When the heeling got really bad, I reassured everyone that this was totally normal for a sailboat of this size (I think), and that the swing keel makes it virtually impossible to capsize from wind alone (I'm almost positive). Ironically, Anisha trusted me when I explained this while Kevin and Sara did not, despite knowing Kevin since we were 6 and Sara being my wife.

We had a good hour under sail before Sara started cowering in the cockpit, shouting profanities, and demanding that we put the sail down, so all in all I'd say it was a successful first sail for Bananas. Kevin and Anisha said they couldn't wait to go back out on the boat one day, which I'd imagine is something that every boat owner loves hearing. The plan now is to practice, practice, practice, and give Sara some exposure therapy with future sails.
