I purchased Bananas on 8/19/2020 and the following weekend, she made the trip from Essex, Maryland to Sparrow's Point with no drama.

I've since taken some time to inspect it and while I definitely have my work cut out for me, it is currently sea-worthy. I was able to go out today for the first time with both my wife (Sara) and my son (Leo). While we didn't exactly raise the sails properly, it wasn't through lack of trying and I did learn a lot about what NOT to do when raising the sails. Mainly, don't ask your wife to steer straight into the wind while also making sure a 2 year old doesn't fall overboard. I'm going to go out with a more experienced sailor to get a couple pointers before the season is over, but we all had a fun time powering around and the weather was beautiful.

It's wonderful that Bananas does so well out on the water already. It means that the things I do need to fix are more for comfort than necessity. I'm thinking that the first item on my list to fix is the stereo because you need music to get other work done efficiently, right? I believe it's due to a broken fuse, so I've bought one and will try replacing it this Wednesday. Then, I'm hoping to get the bilge pump working because there is some water in there.

I'll keep this blog updated with all of the work and play that come along with this new boat.
