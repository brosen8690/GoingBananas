My lifelong friends Kevin and Eugene joined me on Bananas for a day trip to Bodkin creek. The weather was absolutely perfect today, aside from no wind. But it was a great day to 
power around and shoot the stuff. We had snacks, fishing gear, and swimsuits (wishful thinking).

We got to Bodkin Creek easily and set up anchor. This was my first time at anchor on Bananas and, while I love being on the move, it was cool to be able to just relax on the water. We fished (unsuccessfully) and played cards. There were a few too many jellyfish, otherwise I would have gone for a swim. Maybe next year.

On the way out of the creek, Kevin steered us a bit too close to shore and ran us aground. A catamaran anchored a ways off called over asking if we needed help. I told them no as not to bother them, but in reality I had no idea what to do. After a few minutes of panic, a boat passing by suggested that we all stand on one side of the boat and swing the boom out. We gave it a try and, lo and behold, we were able to roll off of the mud and get underway. While it was scary getting stuck like that, I was impressed at how helpful the other boaters all seemed to be. Drivers have never been this helpful when I was stuck on the side of the road.

On the way back we tried lifting the sails anyway. Unfortunately, even the Moana soundtrack wasn't enough to appease the wind Gods and summon a gust. Oh well! There will be plenty more days.
