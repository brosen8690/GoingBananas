My dad came down to help me rig the sails last weekend. The mainsail went up just fine, but we observed that the jib halyard was stuck at the top of the mast. We decided to do some research over the following week and try to get it down the next weekend.

Luckily, we didn't need to take down the entire mast. The halyard line was stuck in the foil and we were able to slide the foil off of the forestay and untangle it (to make a long story short). A passerby at the marina told us we were making a mistake by looking at the instructions, but I cannot imagine how long it would have taken if we didn't have a reference. It definitely saved us from a few stupid mistakes. Lesson learned: always look at the documentation.

After we parted ways, I went home to pick up Sara and Leo for a test sail. There wasn't much wind so we didn't really go anywhere, but the sails (or the "kites", as Leo says) looked nice when they were raised, at least!

Huge shoutout to my dad for all of the help/time he dedicated to getting Bananas' sails in order.
