Went on a journey to Rock Creek today with my friend Justin. It was exceptionally foggy, which was a new experience. Justin was understandably nervous about the fog, but luckily boats are slow enough and the river is wide enough that we weren't in danger of any collisions.

We tried to catch some wind with the newly rigged sails, but it wasn't happening today (most likely a user error on my part). But we still had a good time powering around and listening to SahBabii, the God-tier boat music.
